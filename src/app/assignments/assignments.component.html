   <h1>Assignments</h1>
   <p>There will be three assignments in this class, one deconstruction of HCI research papers conducted individually and two research proposals developed in small groups.</p>
   <h2 id="paperdeconstruction">Paper Deconstruction</h2>
   <p>Select two <a href="https://chi2022.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/selecting-a-subcommittee/">subcommittees at CHI</a> that are of interest to you. Select one subcommittee which focuses on a method or approach, and one which focuses on an application area (reasonable people would disagree with Daniel's categorization, but it's intended to encourage reflection on how contributions are articulated). You may select a subcommittee which we are not planning to cover this quarter, and are encouraged to select at least one subcommittee which is not a typical area you would plan to conduct research in.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Methods and Approaches:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>User Experience and Usability</li>
         <li>Design</li>
         <li>Building Devices: Hardware, Materials, and Fabrication</li>
         <li>Interacting with Devices: Interaction Techniques & Modalities</li>
         <li>Blending Interaction: Engineering Interactive Systems & Tools</li>
         <li>Understanding People: Theory, Concepts, and Methods</li>
         <li>Critical Computing, Sustainability, and Social Justice</li>
         <li>Computational Interaction</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Application Areas:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Specific Applications Areas</li>
         <li>Learning, Education, and Families</li>
         <li>Interaction Beyond the Individual</li>
         <li>Games and Play</li>
         <li>Privacy and Security</li>
         <li>Visualization</li>
         <li>Health</li>
         <li>Accessibility and Aging</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <p>For each of the two subcommittees, select a paper from the list of example papers, ideally a paper which you have not read previously. Deconstruct each of the two papers to identify the intended contribution, literature the contrubtion builds upon, and main findings. Specifically, each paper deconstruction should include the following (1-2 pages):</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Indication of which subcommittee and paper was selected (1 sentence).</li>
      <li>Description of the paper's <em>contribution to the HCI literature</em> and identification of what kind of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2907069">research contribution</a> is being made (1 paragraph).</li>
      <li>Description of the <em>bodies of literature</em> the submission builds upon, and articulation of how it extends that literature (1 paragraph).</li>
      <li>Description of the <em>main finding(s)</em> of the paper (1 paragraph). These will elaborate on the contribution described above, perhaps by offering empirical findings, supporting evidence to the argument, or suggestions for how to design or implement an interface.</li>
      <li>Description of the <em>main takeaway(s)</em> for the HCI community based on the findings (1 paragraph). These may be implications for the design of technology or understanding of how people use or coexist with technology.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Finally, write one additional paragraph reflecting on the organization of the two papers. In what section(s) were each of the above topics written? Were the sections roughly the same across the two papers you read, or were there differences? If there were differences, why do you think they were structured differently?</p>
   <p>The papers' authors may (or may not) have clearly included the above in their paper. You must write these answers <em>in your own words</em> rather than copying the author's descriptions. You may find it helpful to refer to Wobbrock's <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/Wobbrock-2015.pdf">Catchy Titles are Good: But Avoid Being Cute</a> as you consider how the papers are structured.</p>
   <h3>Grading</h3>
   <p>This will be graded on a scale of 15 points, broken down as follows.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The paper's contributions to HCI (3 points)</li>
      <li>The bodies of literature the papers draw on (3 points)</li>
      <li>The main findings of the papers (3 points)</li>
      <li>The main takeaways for HCI based on the findings (4 points)</li>
      <li>Reflection on the organization and structure of the papers (2 points)</li>

   <h2 id="proposal1draft">Research Proposal 1</h2>
   <p>Imagine that a funding agency interested in supporting work in HCI (e.g., the National Science Foundation, a Fellowship funder) has recently put out four call for proposals:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The Future of Health</li>
      <li>The Future of User Interface Software and Technology</li>
      <li>The Future of Interaction Beyond the Individual</li>
      <li>The Future of Critical Computing, Sustainability, and Social Justice</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Pretend you are a researcher whose work is at the intersection of two of these areas (e.g., Health and Social Justice, Accessibility and Critical Computing). You may pick any two of these four areas, though it's encouraged that at least one is an area you are less familiar with. Identify a research topic that sits at that intersection. Develop two proposals, one for each call, which introduces the importance of your research topic and briefly outlines a project that you could conduct.</p>
   <p>The research proposals will help you develop the skill of articulating the importance of research topics in HCI, and help you describe the research value of a topic to multiple audiences. For examples of real calls for proposals in these kinds of areas, see NSF's solicitations relating to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22533/nsf22533.htm#toc">The Future of Work</a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21530/nsf21530.htm#toc">Smart Health in the AI Era</a>.</p>
   <p id="proposal1groups">The research proposal must be completed in groups of two to three. Individuals or larger groups will only be allowed under exceptional circumstances.</p>
   <span *ngFor="let assignment of assignments">
      <div *ngIf="assignment.anchor == 'proposal1groups'">
         <p>Please let Daniel know who is in your group by {{assignment.dueLong}}.</p>
      </div>
   </span>
   <h3>Structure</h3>
   <p>Each proposal should include the following (about 2 pages):</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Indication of which call the proposal is intended for (1 sentence).</li>
      <li>An introduction (~4 paragraphs), which describes the importance of the research topic. The two proposals will inevitably have some overlap, but each should relate the research topic to the call for proposal it is being submitted to.</li>
      <li>Description of a research question related to that topic (~1 sentence) that could be answered.</li>
      <li>A sketch (~1 paragraph) of how the research question could be answered. Provide a high-level description: the style of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2907069">HCI research contribution</a> which would be made, describe the style of study, artifact, dataset, argument, etc. that could be conducted or produced. For example, it is sufficient to describe what sort of data a study would result in (qualitative, quantitative, mixed), to articulate the theories the argument would build off of, to describe the design of artifact that could be developed, etc. It is not necessary to propose a method of analysis (e.g., statistical, grounded theory), describe a number of participants, or describe how an artifact could be implemented.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Finally, the paper should include a reflection (~1 page) considering how the two proposals differ from one another. This reflection should discuss the framings in the two introductions, describing the similarities and differences in how the topic's importance was articulated. It should also briefly compare how the reserach questions and approaches to answering them differed across the proposals. Your final document should be no more than 5 pages in total: about 2 pages for each of the two proposals, plus 1 page for reflection. You may include references to help motivate the research topic, which do not count towards the page limit.</p>
   <p>It is not expected that you or anyone in your group is an expert on the research topic you focus on. Your proposal will therefore not be evaluated on the novelty of the research questions you propose. You will be primarily evaluated on the attempt at motivating your research area in light of the different calls and developing clear research proposals.</p>
   <h3>Draft Submission</h3>
   <p>The draft will be graded on completion, with partial credit or no credit reserved for incomplete proposals.</p>

   </span>
   <h3 id="proposal1feedback">Feedback</h3>
   <p>Your group will be paired with another group. Please read the other group's draft on Perusall and leave feedback. In-class, we will discuss your proposals and the feedback you received.</p>
   <h3 id="proposal1final">Final Submission</h3>
   <p>You are encouraged to iterate on your draft after the feedback session, addressing comments to form a stronger proposal. It is expected that all drafts will have room for improvement, but the amount of iteration required will vary by group.</p>

      </div>
   </span>
   <h3>Grading</h3>
   <p>This will be graded on a scale of 15 points, broken down as follows.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Submission of a complete draft (2 points)</li>
      <li>Quality of the final proposal (13 points)</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Articulation of the importance and relevance of the research topic in the introductions (6 points)</li>
         <li>Identification of clear research questions (2 points)</li>
         <li>Creation of sketches which, if undertaken, would help answer the research questions (2 points)</li>
         <li>Reflection on the proposal differences (3 points)</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <h2 id="proposal2draft">Research Proposal 2</h2>
   <p>Proposal 2 follows an identical structure to Proposal 1. However, the funding agency has instead put out four new calls for proposals:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The Future of Accessibility and Aging</li>
      <li>The Future of Games and Play</li>
      <li>The Future of Privacy and Security</li>
      <li>The Future of Learning, Education, and Families</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Imagine you are a different researcher whose work is at the intersection of two of these areas. Develop two proposals, one for each call, which introduces the importance of your research topic and briefly outlines a project that you could conduct. Structure your proposals the same as your proposals in the prior assignment.</p>
   <p>Proposal 2 is again completed in groups of two to three. Working with different people than for the previous proposal may help you learn from other's styles, but may not be possible given other constraints.</p>
   <h3 id="proposal2final">Submission and Grading</h3>
   <p id="proposal2feedback">There will be opportunity for feedback and discussion in the last class session. Proposal 2 will be graded on the same 15-point scale as Proposal 1.</p>
